# Covid-19 Tracker - Global and Historical Statistics

Covid-19 Tracker is a comprehensive React-based application that allows users to view both global and historical statistics of the Covid-19 pandemic. 

It fetches live data from the [disease.sh](https://disease.sh/) API, allowing users to get up-to-date information about the global state of the virus and its impact across different countries. 

The project provides the following features:
- **Global Statistics**: View the total number of active cases, deaths, and recoveries worldwide. The data is updated in real-time and is displayed in an easy-to-read and accessible manner.
- **Country-specific Statistics**: Search for specific countries to get detailed statistics for that region. It provides users with a focused view and enables them to track the progress of the pandemic in any country.
- **Historical Data**: Access to the historical data of the pandemic, offering users a time-bound perspective of the cases, deaths, and recoveries. 
- **Interactive Charts**: The statistics are presented in interactive charts, making it easier to visualize the data and understand the trends. This includes a line chart for current statistics and a custom historical data chart.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on a variety of screen sizes.

It's built using the React JavaScript library with the addition of several packages for additional functionality, such as axios for promise-based HTTP requests, and the Material UI library for a modern and responsive UI design. The code is written in a functional style with the help of React hooks for state management and side effects. 

This project is ideal for those looking to understand how to consume APIs in a React application, manipulate the received data, and create a responsive UI using Material UI. It also serves as an excellent reference for implementing and managing local state in a functional component with React hooks.
